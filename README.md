NASA API-Project:

Features:

➡️ We have to input a date, and when we do, we will get the "picture of the day" of NASA for that particular day with an explanation of the image, the copyright owner, the title of the image, and the url of this image as well. We can download the picture as well. 
I have used the IPython library to display the image.

➡️After that, when we press the "*" button, we will get an audio file that reads the explanation section. We can download that audio as well. 
I have used the "gtts" Google Text to Speech library to convert the text explanation of the image into an audio file. 
You can hear the audio explanation at last.
